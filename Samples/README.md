# Samples

Sample applications used as test hosts and manual acceptance testing.

Most subdirectories contain an xcodeproj per platform/version, with one or more targets describing variants of applications targeting it, and including the Sentry SDK via a subproject reference. Each sample xcodeproj is included in the top level Sentry.xcworkspace.
