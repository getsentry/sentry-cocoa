    <h1>Collection of samples using the Sentry Cocoa SDK</h1>
</p>

The workspace at the root of the repository include the all of these samples as well as the SDK code itself. 

You can test it by opening the `Sentry.wcworkspace` in the parent directory, adding your [`DSN`](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/cocoa/) to the selected sample and running it.
