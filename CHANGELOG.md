**Breaking Change**: This version uses the [envelope endpoint](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/envelopes/).
If you are using an on-premise installation it requires Sentry version
`>= v20.6.0` to work. If you are using sentry.io nothing will change and
no action is needed. Furthermore, with this version
[auto session tracking](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/blob/7876949ca78aebfe7883432e35727993c5c30829/Sources/Sentry/include/SentryOptions.h#L101)
is enabled per default.
[This feature](https://docs.sentry.io/product/releases/health/)
is collecting and sending health data about the usage of your
application.
We are going to add the official migration guide in one of the next beta releases.

```

- Added internal support for upcoming react-native support
- Exposed `maxCrumbs` so the maximum amount of breadcrumbs can be adjusted

## 2.0.1

- Fixed a bug with not sending `release` with event
- Changed the way how swizzling works, there should not be a problem with e.g.: New Relic anymore

## 2.0.0 - Rename from SentrySwift to Sentry

- We decided to rename `SentrySwift` to just `Sentry`

  Version `2.0.0` has the same features as `1.4.5`.

  to
  `import Sentry`

## 1.4.3

- Fixed an issue where properties of an event will be overwritten before sending
- Added `SentryClient.shared?.enableThreadNames` variable which can be set to true in order to retrieve the thread names when a crash happens. Enable this on you own risk this could deadlock you app therefore its not yet officially documented.
