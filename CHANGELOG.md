**Warning:** this breaks some SPM integrations. Use 8.14.1 if you integrate using SPM.

- GA of MetricKit integration (#3340)

Once enabled, this feature subscribes to [MetricKit's](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metrickit) [MXDiagnosticPayload](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metrickit/mxdiagnosticpayload) data, converts it to events, and sends it to Sentry.
The MetricKit integration subscribes to [MXHangDiagnostic](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metrickit/mxhangdiagnostic),
[MXDiskWriteExceptionDiagnostic](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metrickit/mxdiskwriteexceptiondiagnostic),
and [MXCPUExceptionDiagnostic](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metrickit/mxcpuexceptiondiagnostic).

## Important Note

**Do not use this version** if you use Release Health. It introduces a bug where crashed Sessions would not be reported correctly. This has been fixed in [version `8.9.3`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/releases/tag/8.9.3).

### Improvements

- Reduced macOS SDK footprint by 2% (#3157) with similar changes for tvOS and watchOS (#3158, #3159, #3161)

### Fixes

- Fix a crash in SentryCoreDataTracker for nil error params (#3152)

## 8.9.1

### Fixes

- Fix potential unbounded memory growth when starting profiled transactions from non-main contexts (#3135)

## 8.9.0

### Features

- Symbolicate locally only when debug is enabled (#3079)

This change considerably speeds up retrieving stacktraces, which the SDK uses for captureMessage, captureError and also for reporting file IO or DB operation on the main thread.

- Sanitize HTTP info from breadcrumbs, spans and events (#3094)

### Breaking change

- Renamed `enableTimeToFullDisplay` to `enableTimeToFullDisplayTracing` (#3106)
    - This is an experimental feature and may change at any time without a major revision.

## 8.9.0-beta.1

### Features

- Symbolicate locally only when debug is enabled (#3079)
- Sanitize HTTP info from breadcrumbs, spans and events (#3094)


## 8.8.0

### Features

- Experimental support for Swift Async stacktraces (#3051)
- Cache binary images to be used for crashes (#2939)

### Fixes

- Fix a data race for `SentryId.empty` (#3072)
- Duplicated HTTP breadcrumbs (#3058)
- Expose SentryPrivate and SentrySwiftUI schemes for cartahge clients that have `--no-use-binaries` option (#3071)
- Convert last remaining `sprintf` call to `snprintf` (#3077)
- Fix a crash when serializing profiling data (#3092)

## 8.7.4

### Fixes

- Changed `Trace` serialized value of `sampled` from string to boolean (#3067)

### Breaking Changes

- Removed `nameForSentrySampleDecision` which shouldn't have been public (#3067)

## 8.7.3

### Fixes

- Convert one of the two remaining usages of `sprintf` to `snprintf` (#2866)
- Fix use-after-free ASAN warning (#3042)
- Fix memory leaks in the profiler (#3055, #3061)

## 8.7.2

### Fixed

- Fix crashes in profiling serialization race condition (#3018, #3035)
- Fix a crash for user interaction transactions (#3036)

## 8.7.1

### Fixes

- Add `sent_at` to envelope header (#2859)
- Fix import of `User` & `Breadcrumb` (#3017)

## 8.7.0

### Features

- Allow starting the SDK with an initial scope (#2982)
- Swift Error Names (#2960)

```Swift
enum LoginError: Error {
    case wrongUser(id: String)
    case wrongPassword
}

SentrySDK.capture(error: LoginError.wrongUser("12345678"))
```

For the Swift error above Sentry displays:

| sentry-cocoa SDK | Title | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Since 8.7.0 | `LoginError` | `wrongUser(id: "12345678") (Code: 1)` |
| Before 8.7.0 | `LoginError` | `Code: 1` |

[Customized error descriptions](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/apple/usage/#customizing-error-descriptions) have precedence over this feature.
This change has no impact on grouping of the issues in Sentry.

### Fixes 

- Propagate span when copying scope (#2952)
- Remove "/" from crash report file name (#3005)

## 8.6.0

### Features

- Send trace origin (#2957)

[Trace origin](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/performance/trace-origin/) indicates what created a trace or a span. Not all transactions and spans contain enough information to tell whether the user or what precisely in the SDK created it. Origin solves this problem. The SDK now sends origin for transactions and spans.

- Create User and Breadcrumb from map (#2820)

### Fixes 

- Improved performance serializing profiling data (#2863)
- Possible crash in Core Data tracking (#2865)
- Ensure the current GPU frame rate is always reported for concurrent transaction profiling metrics (#2929)
- Move profiler metric collection to a background queue (#2956)

### Removed

- Remove experimental `stitchAsyncCode` from SentryOptions (#2973)

The `stitchAsyncCode` experimental option has been removed from `SentryOptions` as its behavior was unpredictable and sometimes resulted in unexpected errors. We plan to add it back once we fix it, but we don't have an ETA for it.

## 7.14.0

- fix: User feedback crash (#1766)
- feat: Attach screenshots for errors (#1751)

- fix: NSURL warning during SDK initialization (#1764)

## 7.13.0

If you are using self-hosted Sentry, this version requires Sentry version >= [21.9.0](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#2190)
to work or you have to manually disable sending client reports via the `sendClientReports` option.

- feat: Add Client Reports (#1733)
- fix: enableProfiling option via initWithDict (#1743)

## 7.12.0

### Important notice

This release contains a fix for the sampling of transactions. The SDK applied both sample rates for events and transactions when capturing transactions. Previously, when setting sampleRate to 0.0, the SDK would discard all transactions.
This is fixed now by ignoring the sampleRate for transactions. If you use custom values for sampleRate and traceSampleRate or traceSampler, this change will have an impact on you.

If you are using profiling and self-hosted Sentry, this version requires Sentry version >= [22.3.0](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/releases/tag/22.3.0).

## 7.0.0-alpha.0

**Breaking Change**: This version introduces a change to the grouping of issues. The SDK now sets the `inApp`
flag for frames originating from only the main executable using [CFBundleExecutable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/cfbundleexecutable).
In previous versions, all frames originating from the application bundle were marked as `inApp`. This had the
downside of marking frames of private frameworks inside the bundle as `inApp`. This problem is fixed now.
Applications using static frameworks shouldn't be affected by this change.
For more information on marking frames as inApp [docs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/apple/data-management/event-grouping/stack-trace-rules/#mark-in-app-frames).

- fix: Mark frames as inApp #956

## 6.2.1

- fix: Redundant x29 GP register on arm64 and UBSan crash #964

## 6.2.0

With this version, Sentry groups errors by domain and code. MyDomain 1 and MyDomain 2
are going to be two separate issues in Sentry. If you are using self-hosted Sentry,
it requires Sentry version >= v21.2.0 to work. Staying on Sentry < v21.2.0 and upgrading
to this version of the SDK won't do any damage. Sentry will group like in previous
versions, but you will see a new group because we slightly changed the wording. If you
are using sentry.io no action is needed. In case you are not satisfied with this change,
you can take a look at
[SDK fingerprinting](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/apple/data-management/event-grouping/sdk-fingerprinting/)
to group by domain only.

**Breaking Change**: This version uses the [envelope endpoint](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/envelopes/).
If you are using an on-premise installation it requires Sentry version
`>= v20.6.0` to work. If you are using sentry.io nothing will change and
no action is needed. Furthermore, with this version
[auto session tracking](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/blob/7876949ca78aebfe7883432e35727993c5c30829/Sources/Sentry/include/SentryOptions.h#L101)
is enabled per default.
[This feature](https://docs.sentry.io/product/releases/health/)
is collecting and sending health data about the usage of your
application.
We are going to add the official migration guide in one of the next beta releases.

If you are using CocoaPods or Carthage an update should take care of everything, if you were using the source code directly, make sure to remove KSCrash if you were using it.**

We recommend updating if you experience any KSCrash related crashes since we fixed bunch of stuff directly in our codebase now.
