# Launches the SwiftUI Crash Test app and validates that it crashes and relaunches correctly.
# This test run requires one booted simulator to work. So make sure to boot one simulator before
# running this script.

# Background:
# XCTest isn't built for crashing during tests. Instead of using XCTest to press a button and
# let a test app crash, we now use UserDefaults to tell the test app to crash during launch.
# We then simply launch the app again via `xcrun simctl launch` and wait to see if it keeps
# running. This is basically the same as the testCrash of the SwiftUITestSample without using
# XCTests.
