# Upgrading from 5.x to 6.x

In this version there are a few breaking changes. This guide should help you to update your code.

## Configuration Changes

With this version we changed a few things for the configuration:

- [Auto Session Tracking](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/blob/7876949ca78aebfe7883432e35727993c5c30829/Sources/Sentry/include/SentryOptions.h#L101)
is enabled per default.
[This feature](https://docs.sentry.io/product/releases/health/)
is collecting and sending health data about the usage of your
application.

- [Attach stacktraces](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/blob/b5bf9769a158c66a34352556ade243e55f163a27/Sources/Sentry/Public/SentryOptions.h#L109)
 is enabled per default.

- We bumped the minimum iOS version to 9.0.

- Use a BOOL in SentryOptions instead of NSNumber to store booleans.

- We removed [enabled](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/blob/5.2.2/Sources/Sentry/include/SentryOptions.h#L63) on the SentryOptions.

## Breaking Changes

### Store Endpoint

This version uses the [envelope endpoint](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/envelopes/).
If you are using an on-premise installation it requires Sentry version
`>= v20.6.0` to work. If you are using sentry.io nothing will change and
no action is needed. For this change, we also cache events now in envelopes on the disk.
We decided not to take the effort to migrate these few cached events from 5.x to 6.x into
envelopes. Instead we remove them from the disk. This means you might lose a few cached 
events of your users when upgrading.

### SDK Inits

We removed the [deprecated SDK inits](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/blob/5.2.2/Sources/Sentry/include/SentrySDK.h#L35-L47). The recommended way to initialize Sentry is now:

```swift
SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    // ...
}
```

```objective-c
[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    // ...
}];
```

### Cleanup Public Headers

We cleaned up our public headers and made most of our classes private. If you can't access one
of the classes you need please [open an issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/issues/new/choose)
and tell us your use case so we either make the class public again or provide another API for you.

### Use new type SentryId for eventId

In 5.x we use a nullable NSString to represent an event ID. The SDK, Hub and Client returned this
nullable NSString for the event ID for capturing messages, events, errors, etc. With 6.x we have a new type SentryId which is not nullable to represent an event ID.
Instead of returning `nil` when an event coulnd't be queued for submission we return `SentryId.empty`.

`5.x`

```swift
let eventId = SentrySDK.capture(message: "A message")
if (nil != eventId) {
    // event was queued for submission
} else {
    // event wasn't queued for submission
}
```

```objective-c
SentryId *eventId = [SentrySDK captureMessage:@"A message"];
if (nil != eventId) {
    // event was queued for submission
} else {
    // event wasn't queued for submission
}
```

`6.x`

```swift
let eventId = SentrySDK.capture(message: "A message")
if (eventId != SentryId.empty) {
    // event was queued for submission
} else {
    // event wasn't queued for submission
}
```

```objective-c
SentryId *eventId = [SentrySDK captureMessage:@"A message"];
if (eventId != SentryId.empty) {
    // event was queued for submission
} else {
    // event wasn't queued for submission
}
```

### Make Scope nonnull for capture methods

In 5.x you could pass a nullable scope to capture methods of the SDK, Hub and Client, such as
`SentrySdk.captureMessage()`. In 6.x we changed the Scope to nonnull and provide overloads
for the Hub and the Client.

Please checkout the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for a complete list of changes.

# Upgrading from 4.x to 5.x

Here are some examples of how the new SDK works.

### Initialization

`4.x.x`

```swift
do {
    Client.shared = try Client(dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___")
    try Client.shared?.startCrashHandler()
} catch let error {
    print("\(error)")
}
```

```objective-c
NSError *error = nil;
SentryClient *client = [[SentryClient alloc] initWithDsn:@"___PUBLIC_DSN___" didFailWithError:&error];
SentryClient.sharedClient = client;
[SentryClient.sharedClient startCrashHandlerWithError:&error];
if (nil != error) {
    NSLog(@"%@", error);
}
```

`5.x.x`


```swift
SentrySDK.start(options: [
    "dsn": "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    "debug": true
])
```

```objective-c
[SentrySDK startWithOptions:@{
    @"dsn": @"___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    @"debug": @(YES)
}];
```

### Add Breadcrumb

`4.x.x`

```swift
Client.shared?.breadcrumbs.add(Breadcrumb(level: .info, category: "test"))
```

```objective-c
[SentryClient.sharedClient.breadcrumbs addBreadcrumb:[[SentryBreadcrumb alloc] initWithLevel:kSentrySeverityInfo category:@"test"]];
```

`5.x.x`

```swift
SentrySDK.addBreadcrumb(Breadcrumb(level: .info, category: "test"))
```

```objective-c
[SentrySDK addBreadcrumb:[[SentryBreadcrumb alloc] initWithLevel:kSentrySeverityInfo category:@"test"]];
```

### CaptureMessage with tags/environment/extra

`4.x.x`

```swift
let event = Event(level: .debug)
event.message = "Test Message"
event.environment = "staging"
event.extra = ["ios": true]
Client.shared?.send(event: event)
```

```objective-c
SentryEvent *event = [[SentryEvent alloc] initWithLevel:kSentrySeverityDebug];
event.message = @"Test Message";
event.environment = @"staging";
event.extra = @{@"ios": @(YES)};
[SentryClient.sharedClient sendEvent:event withCompletionHandler:nil];
```

`5.x.x`

```swift
SentrySDK.capture(message: "Test Message") { (scope) in
    scope.setEnvironment("staging")
    scope.setExtras(["ios": true])
    let u = Sentry.User(userId: "1")
    u.email = "tony@example.com"
    scope.setUser(u)
}
```

```objective-c
[SentrySDK captureMessage:@"Test Message" withScopeBlock:^(SentryScope * _Nonnull scope) {
    [scope setEnvironment:@"staging"];
    [scope setExtras:@{@"ios": @(YES)}];
    SentryUser *user = [[SentryUser alloc] initWithUserId:@"1"];
    user.email = @"tony@example.com";
    [scope setUser:user];
}];
```

### setUser

`4.x.x`

```swift
let u = User(userId: "1")
u.email = "tony@example.com"
Client.shared?.user = user
```

```objective-c
SentryUser *user = [[SentryUser alloc] initWithUserId:@"1"];
user.email = @"tony@example.com";
SentryClient.sharedClient.user = user;
```

`5.x.x`

```swift
let u = Sentry.User(userId: "1")
u.email = "tony@example.com"
SentrySDK.setUser(u)
```

```objective-c
SentryUser *user = [[SentryUser alloc] initWithUserId:@"1"];
user.email = @"tony@example.com";
[SentrySDK setUser:user];
```
