  # CI speed and reliability are essential for developer productivity. Running UI tests on SauceLabs
  # takes time, and when running multiple CI jobs in parallel for various PRs, SauceLabs becomes the
  # bottleneck. Ideally, we would run our UI tests on a wide range of devices with different OS
  # versions, but that's expensive and doesn't increase the likelihood of catching SDK bugs
  # significantly. Instead, we choose a minimum set of devices. Furthermore, our unit tests surface most
  # SDK bugs.
 
  # We need to run the tests on an iPhone Pro because it has 120Hz refresh rate.
