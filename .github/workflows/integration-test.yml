# Concurrency configuration:
# - We use workflow-specific concurrency groups to prevent multiple CocoaPods integration tests,
#   as these tests involve complex dependency resolution and build processes.
# - For pull requests, we cancel in-progress runs when new commits are pushed since only the
#   latest integration test results matter for validating CocoaPods compatibility.
# - For main branch pushes, we never cancel integration tests to ensure our CocoaPods
#   integration remains functional for all downstream consumers relying on our library.
