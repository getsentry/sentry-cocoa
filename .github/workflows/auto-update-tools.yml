# This workflow is used to update the custom tooling versions for the project.
#
# We prefer to use Dependabot to update external dependencies, but at this time it does not include Homebrew as a supported package manager (https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/ecosystems-supported-by-dependabot/supported-ecosystems-and-repositories).
# Furthermore, neither `swiftlint` nor `clang-format` are listed as dependencies in our repository, therefore also not picked up by Dependabot.
#
# Therefore we are using a custom workflow to update relevant files and open a pull request with the changes.

# Permissions configuration:
# - 'contents: write' is required to allow the workflow to commit changes to the repository
#   when updating the tooling version files and creating branches for pull requests.
# - 'pull-requests: write' is required to allow the workflow to create pull requests
#   using the peter-evans/create-pull-request action when tooling version updates are available.
permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write

# Concurrency configuration:
# - We use a named concurrency group to prevent multiple instances of this workflow from running
#   simultaneously, which could lead to race conditions when creating branches and pull requests.
#   Since this workflow modifies version files and creates PRs, concurrent runs could interfere
#   with each other, resulting in conflicting branches or duplicate PRs.
# - We enable cancellation of in-progress runs because only the most recent run matters for
#   version updates. There's no value in completing outdated runs, especially for scheduled
#   workflows that might queue up overnight. This approach conserves GitHub Actions minutes
#   and ensures we're always working with the latest repository state.
