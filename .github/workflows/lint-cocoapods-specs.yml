# Concurrency configuration:
# - We use workflow-specific concurrency groups to prevent multiple lint runs on the same code,
#   as linting checks are deterministic and don't require parallel validation.
# - For pull requests, we cancel in-progress runs when new commits are pushed since only the
#   latest linting matters for merge decisions.
# - For main branch pushes, we never cancel formatting checks to ensure our code maintains consistent style
#   standards across the entire project.
