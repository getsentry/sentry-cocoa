# Concurrency configuration:
# - We use workflow-specific concurrency groups to allow independent test runs across different workflows
#   while preventing multiple runs of the same test suite on the same branch/commit.
# - For pull requests, we cancel in-progress runs when new commits are pushed to save CI resources
#   and provide faster feedback on the latest changes.
# - For main branch pushes and scheduled runs, we never cancel in-progress runs to ensure the complete
#   test suite always finishes, maintaining the integrity of our main branch quality gates.

  # This job detects if the PR contains changes that require running tests for 3rd-party integrations.
  # If yes, the job will output a flag that will be used by the next job to run the tests for 3rd-party integrations.
  # If no, the job will output a flag that will be used by the next job to skip running the tests for 3rd-party integrations.
  # At the end of this workflow, we run a check that validates that either all tests for 3rd-party integrations passed or were
  # called unit-tests-required-check.
