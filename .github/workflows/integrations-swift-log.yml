# Concurrency configuration:
# - We use workflow-specific concurrency groups to allow independent test runs across different workflows
#   while preventing multiple runs of the same test suite on the same branch/commit.
# - For pull requests, we cancel in-progress runs when new commits are pushed to save CI resources
#   and provide faster feedback on the latest changes.
# - For main branch pushes and scheduled runs, we never cancel in-progress runs to ensure the complete
#   test suite always finishes, maintaining the integrity of our main branch quality gates.

  # This job detects if the PR contains changes that require running unit tests.

  # At the end of this workflow, we run a check that validates that either all unit tests passed or were
