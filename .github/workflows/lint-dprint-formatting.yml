# We want to run dprint for only the files it checks without running the other linters, which are
# expensive. For example, dprint should run for markdown changes, but pod lib lint doesn't need to
# run for markdown changes. Therefore, we run it in an extra workflow.

# Concurrency configuration:
# - We use workflow-specific concurrency groups to prevent multiple lint runs on the same code,
#   as linting checks are deterministic and don't require parallel validation.
# - For pull requests, we cancel in-progress runs when new commits are pushed since only the latest
#   linting matters for merge decisions.
# - For main branch pushes, we never cancel formatting checks to ensure our code maintains consistent
#   style standards across the entire project.

  # This job detects if the PR contains changes that require running dprint linting.

  # If no, the job will output a flag that will be used by the next job to skip running the dprint linting.
  # At the end of this workflow, we run a check that validates that either all dprint linting passed or were
  # skipped, called lint-dprint-required-check.
