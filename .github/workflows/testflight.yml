# Concurrency configuration:
# - We use workflow-specific concurrency groups to prevent multiple TestFlight uploads of the same build,
#   as these operations involve app building, signing, and upload to Apple's servers.
# - For pull requests, we cancel in-progress runs when testing workflow changes since only the
#   latest configuration needs validation before merging.
# - For main branch pushes (actual uploads), we never cancel uploads to ensure every main branch
#   commit gets properly built and distributed to TestFlight for testing by our team.
