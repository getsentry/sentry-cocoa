# Concurrency configuration:
# - We use workflow-specific concurrency groups to prevent multiple Objective-C conversion analysis runs,
#   as these analyze code conversion progress and generate tracking reports.
# - For pull requests, we cancel in-progress runs when new commits are pushed since only the
#   latest conversion analysis matters for tracking progress on SwiftConversion changes.
# - For main branch pushes, we never cancel conversion analysis to ensure we maintain accurate
#   tracking of our Objective-C to Swift conversion progress across the entire project.
