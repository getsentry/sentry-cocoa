  # Ensure the swizzling of network classes doesn't break the normal functionality of web requests.
  # We borrow the tests of Alamofire under the MIT license: https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire.
  # The following steps checkout Alamofire and apply a github patch to the project. The patch adds
  # Sentry to the tests with auto performance monitoring enabled. While the tests are running a 
  # transaction is bound to the scope, so the Sentry SDK adds spans to the transaction. This doesn't
  # validate if the Sentry SDK adds proper spans. It only validates that the swizzling logic
  # doesn't break web requests.
