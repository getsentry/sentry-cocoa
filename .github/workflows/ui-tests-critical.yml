# Concurrency configuration:
# - We use workflow-specific concurrency groups to prevent multiple critical UI test runs,
#   as these test the most essential user interface functionality and are resource-intensive.
# - For pull requests, we cancel in-progress runs when new commits are pushed to provide
#   faster feedback on critical functionality and avoid wasting expensive testing resources.
# - For main branch pushes, we never cancel critical UI tests to ensure the most important
#   user interface features are always validated before code reaches production.
