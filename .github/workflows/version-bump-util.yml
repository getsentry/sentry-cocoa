# Concurrency configuration:
# - We use workflow-specific concurrency groups to prevent multiple version bump utility tests,
#   as these test critical release infrastructure and version management tools.
# - For pull requests, we cancel in-progress runs when new commits are pushed since only the
#   latest version utility behavior matters for validating release process changes.
# - For main branch pushes, we never cancel version utility tests to ensure our release
#   infrastructure remains reliable and our version bumping tools work correctly.
