# Concurrency configuration:
# - We use workflow-specific concurrency groups to prevent multiple UI test runs on the same code,
#   as UI tests are resource-intensive and long-running operations.
# - For pull requests, we cancel in-progress runs when new commits are pushed to provide faster
#   feedback and avoid wasting expensive UI testing resources on outdated code.
# - For main branch pushes, we never cancel UI tests to ensure complete validation of the user
#   interface before the code reaches production, maintaining our quality standards.
