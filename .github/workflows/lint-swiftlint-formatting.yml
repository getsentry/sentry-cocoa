# Concurrency configuration:
# - We use workflow-specific concurrency groups to prevent multiple lint runs on the same code,
#   as linting checks are deterministic and don't require parallel validation.
# - For pull requests, we cancel in-progress runs when new commits are pushed since only the latest
#   linting matters for merge decisions.
# - For main branch pushes, we never cancel formatting checks to ensure our code maintains consistent
#   style standards across the entire project.

jobs:
  # This job detects if the PR contains changes that require running lint-swiftlint.
  # If yes, the job will output a flag that will be used by the next job to run the lint-swiftlint.
  # If no, the job will output a flag that will be used by the next job to skip running the lint-swiftlint.
  # At the end of this workflow, we run a check that validates that either lint_swiftlint-required-check passed or were
  # skipped, which is called lint_swiftlint-required-check.
