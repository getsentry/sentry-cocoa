# Concurrency configuration:
# - We use workflow-specific concurrency groups to prevent multiple CodeQL security analysis runs,
#   as these are comprehensive security scans that shouldn't run simultaneously.
# - For pull requests, we cancel in-progress runs when new commits are pushed since only the
#   latest security analysis results matter for identifying potential vulnerabilities.
# - For main branch pushes and scheduled runs, we never cancel security analysis to ensure
#   complete security validation and maintain our security baseline with weekly scheduled scans.
