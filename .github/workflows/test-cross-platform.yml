# Concurrency configuration:
# - We use workflow-specific concurrency groups to prevent multiple cross-platform tests,
#   as these involve complex React Native and cross-platform integration setups.
# - For pull requests, we cancel in-progress runs when new commits are pushed since only the
#   latest cross-platform compatibility results matter for validating multi-platform support.
# - For main branch pushes, we never cancel cross-platform tests to ensure our SDK remains
#   compatible with React Native and other cross-platform frameworks that depend on us.
