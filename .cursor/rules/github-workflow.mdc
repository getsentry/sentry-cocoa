# Cursor Rules for Sentry Cocoa Repository

## GitHub Workflow Naming Convention

### Workflow Names (Top-level `name:` field)

Use concise, action-oriented names that describe the workflow's primary purpose:

**Format:** `[Action] [Subject]`

**Examples:**
- ✅ `Release` (not "Release a new version")
- ✅ `UI Tests` (not "Sentry Cocoa UI Tests")
- ✅ `Benchmarking` (not "Run benchmarking tests")
- ✅ `Lint SwiftLint` (not "Lint Swiftlint Formatting")
- ✅ `Test CocoaPods` (not "CocoaPods Integration Test")

### Job Names (Job-level `name:` field)

Use clear, concise descriptions that avoid redundancy with the workflow name:

**Principles:**
1. **Remove redundant prefixes** - Don't repeat the workflow name
2. **Use action verbs** - Start with what the job does
3. **Avoid version-specific naming** - Don't include Xcode versions, tool versions, etc.
4. **Keep it concise** - Maximum 3-4 words when possible

**Patterns:**

#### Build Jobs
- ✅ `Build XCFramework Slice` (not "Build XCFramework Variant Slice")
- ✅ `Assemble XCFramework` (not "Assemble XCFramework Variant")
- ✅ `Build App and Test Runner`

#### Test Jobs
- ✅ `Test ${{matrix.target}} V3 # Up the version with every change to keep track of flaky tests`
- ✅ `Test iOS Swift V5 # Up the version with every change to keep track of flaky tests`
- ✅ `Test SwiftUI V4 # Up the version with every change to keep track of flaky tests`
- ✅ `Test Sentry Duplication V4 # Up the version with every change to keep track of flaky tests`

**Note:** Version numbers (V1, V2, etc.) are included in test job names for flaky test tracking, with explanatory comments retained.

#### Validation Jobs
- ✅ `Validate XCFramework` (not "Validate XCFramework - Static")
- ✅ `Validate SPM Static` (not "Validate Swift Package Manager - Static")
- ✅ `Check API Stability` (not "API Stability Check")

#### Lint Jobs
- ✅ `Lint` (job name when workflow already specifies the tool, e.g., "Lint SwiftLint")
- ❌ `SwiftLint` (redundant with workflow name "Lint SwiftLint")
- ❌ `Clang Format` (redundant with workflow name "Lint Clang")

#### Utility Jobs
- ✅ `Collect App Metrics` (not "Collect app metrics")
- ✅ `Detect File Changes` (not "Detect Changed Files")
- ✅ `Release New Version` (not "Release a new version")

### Version Tracking for Flaky Test Management

For UI test jobs that need version tracking for flaky test management, include the version number in BOTH the job name AND a comment:

**Format:** `[Job Name] V{number} # Up the version with every change to keep track of flaky tests`

**Example:**
```yaml
name: Test iOS Swift V5 # Up the version with every change to keep track of flaky tests
```

**Rationale:** 
- Version numbers must be in the job name because failure rate monitoring captures job names and ignores comments
- Comments are kept to provide context and instructions for developers

### Matrix Variables in Names

When using matrix variables, prefer descriptive names over technical details:

**Examples:**
- ✅ `Test ${{matrix.target}}` where target = "ios_objc", "tvos_swift"
- ✅ `Check API Stability (${{ matrix.version }})` where version = "default", "v9"
- ❌ `Test iOS Swift Xcode ${{matrix.xcode}}` (version-specific)

### Reusable Workflow Names

For reusable workflows (workflow_call), use descriptive names that indicate their purpose:

**Examples:**
- ✅ `Build XCFramework Slice`
- ✅ `Assemble XCFramework`
- ✅ `UI Tests Common`

### Benefits of This Convention

1. **Status Check Stability** - Names won't break when tool versions change
2. **Cleaner GitHub UI** - Shorter, more readable names in PR checks
3. **Better Organization** - Consistent patterns make workflows easier to understand
4. **Future-Proof** - Version-agnostic naming reduces maintenance overhead
5. **Branch Protection Compatibility** - Stable names work well with GitHub's branch protection rules

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Don't include:**
- Tool versions (Xcode 15.4, Swift 5.9, etc.)
- Redundant workflow prefixes ("Release /", "UI Tests /")
- Overly verbose descriptions
- Technical implementation details in user-facing names
- Lowercase inconsistency

❌ **Examples of what NOT to do:**
- "Release / Build XCFramework Variant Slice (Sentry, mh_dylib, -Dynamic, sentry-dynamic) / Build XCFramework Slice"
- "UI Tests / UI Tests for iOS-Swift Xcode 15.4 - V5"
- "Lint Swiftlint Formatting / SwiftLint" (redundant job name)
- "Build Sentry Cocoa XCFramework Variant Slice"

### Implementation Notes

- Always include version numbers in test job names AND keep explanatory comments for flaky test management
- Keep matrix variable usage minimal and descriptive
- Ensure names remain meaningful when viewed in GitHub's status check UI
- Test names in the GitHub PR interface before committing changes
- For lint workflows, use simple "Lint" job name since the tool is already specified in the workflow name
