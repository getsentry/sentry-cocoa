# Develop Documentation

This page contains internal documentation for development.

## Coding with Swift

To use Swift in the project take a look at [Swift Usage](Swift-Usage.md) documentation.

## Code Signing

This repository follows the [codesiging.guide](https://codesigning.guide/) in combination with [fastlane match](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/match/).
Therefore the sample apps use manual code signing, see [fastlane docs](https://docs.fastlane.tools/codesigning/xcode-project/):
> In most cases, fastlane will work out of the box with Xcode 9 and up if you selected manual code signing and choose a provisioning profile name for each of your targets.

### Creating new App Identifiers

E.g. if you create a new extension target, like a File Provider for iOS-Swift, make sure it has a unique bundle identifier like `io.sentry.sample.iOS-Swift.FileProvider`. Then, run the following terminal command:

```
rbenv exec bundle exec fastlane produce -u andrew.mcknight@sentry.io --skip_itc -a io.sentry.sample.iOS-Swift.FileProvider
```

You'll be prompted for an Apple Developer Portal 2FA code, and the description for the identifier; in this example, "Sentry Cocoa Sample Swift File Provider Extension".

### Creating provisioning profiles

For an existing app identifier, run the terminal command, after changing the email address in the Matchfile to your personal ADP account's:

```
rbenv exec bundle exec fastlane match development --app_identifier io.sentry.sample.iOS-Swift.FileProvider
```

You can include the `--force` option to regenerate an existing profile.

### Help

Reach out to a [CODEOWNER](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/blob/main/.github/CODEOWNERS) if you need access to the match git repository.

## Unit Tests with Thread Sanitizer

CI runs the unit tests for one job with thread sanitizer enabled to detect race conditions.
To ignore false positives or known issues, use the `SENTRY_DISABLE_THREAD_SANITIZER` macro or the [suppression file](../Sources/Resources/ThreadSanitizer.sup).
It's worth noting that you can use the `$(PROJECT_DIR)` to specify the path to the suppression file.
To run the unit tests with the thread sanitizer enabled in Xcode click on edit scheme, go to tests, then open diagnostics, and enable Thread Sanitizer.
The profiler doesn't work with TSAN attached, so tests that run the profiler will be skipped.

## Test Logs

The [`SentryTestLogConfig`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/blob/3a6ab6ec167d2532c024322a0a0019431275d1c1/Tests/SentryTests/TestUtils/SentryTestLogConfig.m) sets the log level to debug in `load`, so we understand what's going on during out tests.
The  [`clearTestState`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/blob/3a6ab6ec167d2532c024322a0a0019431275d1c1/SentryTestUtils/ClearTestState.swift#L25) method does the same, in case a test changes the log level.

## UI Tests

CI runs UI tests on simulators via the `ui-tests.yml` workflow for every PR and every commit on main.

### Saucelabs

You can find the available devices on [their website](https://saucelabs.com/platform/supported-browsers-devices). Another way to check their available devices is to go to [live app testing](https://app.saucelabs.com/live/app-testing), go to iOS-Swift and click on choose device. This brings the full list of devices with more details.

### Performance benchmarking

Once daily and for every PR via [Github action](../.github/workflows/benchmarking.yml), the benchmark runs in Sauce Labs, on a [high-end device](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/8986f81e19f63ee370b1649e08630c9b946c87ed/src/sentry/profiles/device.py#L43-L49) we categorize. Benchmarks run from an XCUITest (`PerformanceBenchmarks` target) using the iOS-Swift sample app, under the `iOS-Swift-Benchmarking` scheme. [`PerformanceViewController`](../Samples/iOS-Swift/iOS-Swift/ViewControllers/PerformanceViewController.swift) provides a start and stop button for controlling when the benchmarking runs, and a text field to marshal observations from within the test harness app into the test runner app. There, we assert that the P90 of all trials remains under 5%. We also print the raw results to the test runner's console logs for postprocessing into reports with `//scripts/process-benchmark-raw-results.py`.

#### Test procedure

- Tap the button to start a Sentry transaction with the associated profiling.
- Run a loop performing large amount of calculations to use as much CPU as possible. This simulates something an app developer would want to profile in a real world scenario.
- While benchmarking, run a sampling profiler at 10 Hz to calculate the CPU usage of each thread, in particular the Sentry profiler's, to calculate its relative usage.
- Tap the button to stop the transaction after waiting for 15 seconds.
- Calculate the total time used by app threads and separately, the profiler's thread. Keep separated by system call and user call times.
- Write these four values as CSV into the text field accessible as an XCUIElement in the runner app.

#### Test Plan

- Run the procedure 20 times, then assert that the 90th percentile remains under 5% so we can be alerted via CI if it spikes.
    - Sauce Labs allows relaxing the timeout for a suite of tests and for a `XCTestCase` subclass' collection of test case methods, but each test case in the suite must run in less than 15 minutes. 20 trials takes too long, so we split it up into multiple test cases, each running a subset of the trials. 
    - This is done by dynamically generating test case methods in `SentrySDKPerformanceBenchmarkTests`, which is necessarily written in Objective-C since this is not possible to do in Swift tests. By doing this dynamically, we can easily fine tune how we split up the work to account for changes in the test duration or in constraints on how things run in Sauce Labs etc.

## Upload iOS-Swift's dSYMs with Xcode Run Script

The following script applies a patch so Xcode uploads the iOS-Swift's dSYMs to Sentry during Xcode's build phase.
Ensure to not commit the patch file after running this script, which then contains your auth token.

```sh
./scripts/upload-dsyms-with-xcode-build-phase.sh YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
```

## Generating classes

You can use the `generate-classes.sh` to generate ViewControllers and other classes to emulate a large project. This is useful, for example, to test the performance of swizzling in a large project without having to check in thousands of lines of code.

## UIKit

Some customers would like to not link UIKit for various reasons. Either they simply may not want to use our UIKit functionality, or they actually cannot link to it in certain circumstances, like a File Provider app extension.

There are two build configurations they can use for this: `Debug_without_UIKit` and `Release_without_UIKit`, that are essentially the same as `Debug` and `Release` with the following differences:
- They set `CLANG_MODULES_AUTOLINK` to `NO`. This avoids a load command being automatically inserted for any UIKit API that make their way into the type system during compilation of SDK sources.
- `GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS` has an additional setting `SENTRY_NO_UIKIT=1`. This is now part of the definition of `SENTRY_HAS_UIKIT` in `SentryDefines.h` that is used to conditionally compile out any code that would otherwise use UIKit API and cause UIKit to be automatically linked as described above. There is another macro `SENTRY_UIKIT_AVAILABLE` defined as `SENTRY_HAS_UIKIT` used to be, meaning simply that compilation is targeting a platform where UIKit is available to be used. This is used in headers we deliver in the framework bundle to compile out declarations that rely on UIKit, and their corresponding implementations are switched over `SENTRY_HAS_UIKIT` to either provide the logic for configurations that link UIKit, or to provide a stub delivering a default value (`nil`, `0.0`, `NO` etc) and a warning log for publicly facing things like SentryOptions, or debug log for internal things like SentryDependencyContainer.

There are two jobs in `.github/workflows/build.yml` that will build each of the new configs and use `otool -L` to ensure that UIKit does not appear as a load command in the build products.
 
This feature is experimental and is currently not compatible with SPM.

## Logging

We have a set of macros for debugging at various levels defined in SentryLog.h. These are not async-safe; to log from special places like crash handlers, see SentryCrashLogger.h; see the headerdocs in that header for how to work with those logging macros. There are also separate macros in SentryProfilingLogging.hpp specifically for the profiler; these are completely compiled out of release builds due to https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/issues/3336.

## Profiling

The profiler runs on a dedicated thread, and on a predefined interval will enumerate all other threads and gather the backtrace on each non-idle thread. 

The information is stored in deduplicated frame and stack indexed lookups for memory and transmission efficiency. These are maintained in `SentryProfilerState`.

If enabled and sampled in (controlled by `SentryOptions.profilesSampleRate` or `SentryOptions.profilesSampler`), the profiler will start along with a trace, and the profile information is sliced to the start and end of each transaction and sent with them an envelope attachments. 

The profiler will automatically time out if it is not stopped within 30 seconds, and also stops automatically if the app is sent to the background.

There's only ever one profiler instance running at a time, but instances that have timed out will be kept in memory until all traces that ran concurrently with it have finished and serialized to envelopes. The associations between profiler instances and traces are maintained in `SentryProfiledTracerConcurrency`. 

App launches can be automatically profiled if configured with `SentryOptions.enableAppLaunchProfiling`. If enabled, when `SentrySDK.startWithOptions` is called, `SentryLaunchProfiling.configureLaunchProfiling` will get a sample rate for traces and profiles with their respective options, and store those rates in a file to be read on the next launch. On each launch, `SentryLaunchProfiling.startLaunchProfile` checks for the presence of that file is used to decide whether to start an app launch profiled trace, and afterwards retrieves those rates to initialize a `SentryTransactionContext` and `SentryTracerConfiguration`, and provides them to a new `SentryTracer` instance, which is what actually starts the profiler. There is no hub at this time; also in the call to `SentrySDK.startWithOptions`, any current profiled launch trace is attempted to be finished, and the hub that exists by that time is provided to the `SentryTracer` instance via `SentryLaunchProfiling.stopAndTransmitLaunchProfile` so that when it needs to transmit the transaction envelope, the infrastructure is in place to do so.

In testing and debug environments, when a profile payload is serialized for transmission, the dictionary will also be written to a file in application support that can be retrieved by a sample app. This helps with UI tests that want to verify the contents of a profile after some app interaction. See `iOS-Swift.ProfilingViewController.viewLastProfile`  and `iOS-SwiftUITests.ProfilingUITests`.

## Swift and Objective-C Interoperability**

When making an Objective-C class public for Swift SDK code, do the following:

* Add it to SentryPrivate.h
* Remove existing imports from any test bridging headers.
* Add the import `@_implementationOnly import _SentryPrivate` to your Swift class that wants to use
the Objective-C class.

## Public Protocols

pod lib lint fails with the warning duplicate protocol definition when including a public header for
a protocol in a private ObjC class header, when adding that header to `SentryPrivate.h` to expose it
to internal SDK Swift code, as `SentrySDKInfo.h`. To solve this problem we have to use the
`SentryInternalSerializable` for internal classes implementing serializable.

### Detailed explanation of the Swift and Objective-C Interoperability setup

The SentrySDK uses Swift and Objective-C code. Public Objective-C classes, made public
[through the umbrella header](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/importing-objective-c-into-swift#Import-Code-Within-a-Framework-Target),
are automatically visible to Swift without imports. Our umbrella header is defined in the `Sentry.modulemap`.
Accessing private Objective-C classes doesn't
work out of the box. One approach to making this work is to define a private module that contains
all the private ObjC headers. To define such a module, we added a module.modulemap file to our
project with the name _SentryPrivate. We added the prefix `_` because Xcode autocomplete seems to
ignore such modules. This modulemap file points to a header called `SentryPrivate.h`, which include
 all private ObjC headers that should be available for Swift. When importing the generated
 _SentryPrivate module we have to use `@_implementationOnly import _SentryPrivate`.
 [@_implementationOnly](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/main/docs/ReferenceGuides/UnderscoredAttributes.md#_implementationonly)
 will most likely be superseded by [access level imports](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0409-access-level-on-imports.md)
 in a future Swift version. Not using `@_implementationOnly` leads to errors when including the
 prebuilt XCFramwork into projects, such as:

```sh
Sentry.swiftmodule/arm64-apple-ios.private.swiftinterface:10:8: error: no such module '_SentryPrivate'

import _SentryPrivate
```

Adding Objective-C classes to the _SentryPrivate module also exposes them to test classes written in
Swift. When making an Objective-C class public to SDK Swift code, we must remove it from test
bridging headers because this can lead to compiler errors. The SentryTests only find the
_SentryPrivate module when adding setting `HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS = $(SRCROOT)/Sources/Sentry/include/**`
which we must not set for SwiftUI, because this uses its own implementation of SentryInternal.h.
Setting the `HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS` for SwiftUI breaks the build.
